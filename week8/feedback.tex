\section{Introduction and review guidelines}

\subsection{Assignment review}\label{sec:general_review}

The review should provide detailed feedback on the solution to the student. The main goal is to \emph{give constructive feedback and advice} on how to improve the solution. For each (coding) exercise, one should review the following points:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Is the code \textbf{working as expected}? For non-internal functions (in particular for scripts that are run from the command-line), does the program handle invalid inputs sensibly?
  \item Is the code written in \textbf{Pythonic way} \footnote{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/}? Is the code easy to read? Are the variable/class/function names sensible? Do you find overuse of classes or not sufficient use of functions or classes? Are there parts of the program that are hard to understand? 
  \item Is the code \textbf{well documented}? Are there docstrings?
  \item Can you find \textbf{unnecessarily complicated parts} of the program? If so, suggest an improved implementation.
  \item List the programming parts that are not answered.
\end{itemize}
You should use (shortened) code snippets where appropriate to show how to improve the solution. 


\subsection{Useful Latex snippets}
Here are some sample usage of Latex.

\noindent
Equation:
\begin{align}
2 \pi > 6
\end{align}
Sample code:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=LightGray, linenos, fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
import sys
print "This is a sample code"
sys.exit(0)
\end{minted}

\section{Review}\label{sec:review}

Specify the system (Python version, operating system, ...) that was used for the review.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Assignment 5.1:  Python implementation of the heat equation}
Add a review based on section \ref{sec:general_review}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Assignment 5.2: NumPy and C implementations} \label{sec:assignment5.2}
Add a review for \underline{the numpy version and each C-version} in the repository based on section \ref{sec:general_review}.

In addition, review the following assignment specific items: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Does the numpy solution make use of vectorisation sufficiently? 
  \item Does the solution make use of the C implementation sufficiently? 
  \item Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the solution for speed? E.g. can copying of data arrays be avoided.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Assignment 5.3: Testing}
Add a review based on section \ref{sec:general_review}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Assignment 5.4:  Develop a user interface}
Add a review based on section \ref{sec:general_review}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Assignment 5.5: Latex report}
Review the following items: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Does the report describe the performed work well? 
\item Does the report have a comparison between the different implementations? 
\item Does the report explain reason for the runtime differences? Does it provide a technical understanding for performance of the different solutions?
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Assignment 5.6: More C-interfaces}
You can leave this section empty. The review for all C-interfaces should go to section 5.2.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Assignment 5.7: Github activity plot}
Add a review based on section \ref{sec:general_review}.
